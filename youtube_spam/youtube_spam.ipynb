    "comment_id: This column contains a unique identifier for each comment. It is not relevant for modeling and can be ignored during analysis.\n",

    "Author: The name or username of the person who posted the comment. This feature may provide insights into patterns related to spam accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: The date on which the comment was made. Analyzing the dates can reveal trends in spam activity over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content: The actual text content of the comment. This is the primary feature used for training classification models to detect spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "video_name: The name of the YouTube video on which the comment was made. This could provide context or patterns in spam activity across different types of videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "class: The target variable, where 1 indicates a spam comment and 0 indicates a legitimate comment. This column is the focus of the classification task."
